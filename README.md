# Sequinzer
A Python based music sequencer application.

## History
Back in the days of yore, when I attended a coding bootcamp, two of the projects I built were the Sequinzer-6001, and Sequinzer-6000-2a. How they got their numbers isn't important. But, what is important is that they were built using JavaScript, WebAudio, and Tone.js.

#### The Flawwww (Said like "the clawwww" from Toy Story)
The original sequencers had the issue of timing while using the in-browser audi engine. I never really bothered to fix it, but this leaves them mostly unusable. That's one of the reasons I'd like to build a new one, not only cause new shiny things are fun, but because I wanted to see what challenges crop up while building a music application using Python and Pygame.


## Progress
This is a pet project, so progress will be slow.
